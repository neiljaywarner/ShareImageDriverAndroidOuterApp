# POSSIBLE_NEXT_STEPS.md: Using a Clean Flutter SDK Installation

This document outlines steps to diagnose persistent Flutter build issues (specifically, the inability to resolve specific Flutter engine artifacts like `io.flutter:flutter_embedding_debug:1.0.0-cf56914b...`) by using a fresh, clean installation of the Flutter SDK. This helps determine if the issue lies with your current Flutter SDK setup or is more deeply rooted.

**Goal:** To successfully build the `receive_images_flutter_demo` module (either as an AAR or as a source dependency for `ShareImageDriverAndroidOuterApp`) using a pristine Flutter SDK, thereby resolving the engine artifact errors.

--- 

## Step 1: Clone a Fresh Flutter SDK

1.  **Choose a Directory for the New SDK:**
    It's recommended to place it outside your existing Flutter SDK path to avoid conflicts. Your home directory is a good place.

2.  **Open your terminal.**

3.  **Navigate to your home directory (or chosen parent directory for SDKs):**
    ```bash
    cd ~
    ```

4.  **Clone the Flutter repository from the stable channel:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable new_flutter_sdk
    ```
    *   This creates a new directory named `new_flutter_sdk` containing the Flutter SDK.

## Step 2: Configure Your Environment to Use the New SDK (Temporarily)

There are two common ways to do this:

**Method A: Prepend to PATH for the current terminal session (Recommended for testing)**

1.  **In your current terminal session, add the `bin` directory of the new SDK to the beginning of your `PATH` environment variable:**
    ```bash
    export PATH="$HOME/new_flutter_sdk/bin:$PATH"
    ```
    *   **Note:** This change is only for the current terminal session. If you close it or open a new one, you'll revert to your default Flutter SDK unless you re-apply this export or modify your shell profile permanently (see Method B).

2.  **Verify the change:**
    ```bash
    which flutter
    # Expected output: /Users/neil/new_flutter_sdk/bin/flutter (or your home equivalent)
    flutter --version
    # Expected output: Shows version details from the stable channel in new_flutter_sdk
    ```

**Method B: Modify your shell profile (More permanent change if this SDK works)**

1.  **Edit your shell configuration file.** This is usually `~/.zshrc` (for Zsh, common on newer macOS) or `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc` (for Bash).
    *   Example for Zsh:
        ```bash
        open -e ~/.zshrc 
        ```
2.  **Add or modify the line that sets your Flutter SDK path.** Ensure the path to `new_flutter_sdk/bin` is *before* any other Flutter SDK paths.
    ```bash
    export PATH="$HOME/new_flutter_sdk/bin:$PATH"
    ```
3.  **Save the file and reload your shell configuration:**
    *   Example for Zsh:
        ```bash
        source ~/.zshrc
        ```
4.  **Open a NEW terminal window/tab and verify:**
    ```bash
    which flutter
    flutter --version
    ```

## Step 3: Run Flutter Doctor with the New SDK

1.  **In the terminal session where `new_flutter_sdk` is active, run `flutter doctor -v`:**
    ```bash
    flutter doctor -v
    ```
    *   **Look for:**
        *   It should download any necessary Dart SDK updates or other components for this new SDK.
        *   Ensure it shows no critical issues (`[âœ—]` or `[!]`).
    *   **Action:** Address any new issues reported by `flutter doctor` for this SDK.

## Step 4: Clean and Rebuild Flutter Module and Host App

Now, using the terminal where `new_flutter_sdk` is the active Flutter installation:

1.  **Deep Clean the Flutter Module (`receive_images_flutter_demo`):**
    ```bash
    cd /Users/neil/AndroidStudioProjects/receive_images_flutter_demo
    flutter clean 
    rm -rf .android/build .android/.gradle build
    flutter pub get
    ```

2.  **Generate Pigeon Files (if not already up-to-date with latest code):**
    ```bash
    flutter pub run pigeon --input pigeons/image_messages.dart --dart_out lib/pigeon.dart --java_out ./.android/app/src/main/java/com/example/receive_images_flutter_demo/Pigeon.java --java_package com.example.receive_images_flutter_demo --swift_out .ios/Runner/Pigeon.swift
    ```

3.  **Clean the Android Host App (`ShareImageDriverAndroidOuterApp`):**
    ```bash
    cd /Users/neil/AndroidStudioProjects/ShareImageDriverAndroidOuterApp
    ./gradlew clean
    ```

4.  **Attempt to Build the Android Host App (Debug):**
    ```bash
    ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
    ```
    *   **Crucial Check:** Does this build succeed? Are the `Could not find io.flutter:flutter_embedding_debug:1.0.0-cf56914b...` errors (or similar hash-specific errors) gone?

## Step 5: Analyze Results

*   **If the build with `new_flutter_sdk` SUCCEEDS:**
    *   This strongly indicates that your previous Flutter SDK installation was corrupted, incomplete, or had some conflicting configuration (e.g., pinned to an old/specific engine via an overlooked mechanism).
    *   You can now confidently use `new_flutter_sdk` as your primary Flutter SDK. You might want to update your shell profile permanently (Method B in Step 2) if you only used Method A.
    *   You can then proceed with re-engaging the AI assistant to generate the final README files and finalize any remaining integration details, knowing the core build now works.

*   **If the build with `new_flutter_sdk` STILL FAILS with the *exact same* hash-specific engine errors:**
    *   This is a very unusual and unfortunate scenario. It could imply:
        *   Something in your broader system environment (outside the Flutter SDK itself, e.g., specific Java versions, system-wide Gradle properties, or very aggressive caching an IDE might be doing) is still influencing the build in an unexpected way.
        *   The `receive_images_flutter_demo` project files themselves (perhaps an old setting in a `.gradle` file within `.android` that wasn't cleaned, or a very specific `pubspec.lock` interaction) are somehow forcing this specific engine version. Though `flutter clean` and `rm -rf .android/build .android/.gradle` should prevent this.
        *   A bug in the version of `include_flutter.groovy` that comes with the stable channel of Flutter when interacting with your specific project setup or Android Gradle Plugin version.
    *   **Further actions if it still fails:**
        *   Double-check that the `clean` commands were thorough.
        *   Try creating a *brand new minimal Flutter module* with `new_flutter_sdk` and see if *that* integrates cleanly with a *brand new minimal Android host app*. This helps isolate if the issue is tied to your existing project files vs. the general environment.
        *   Consider posting a detailed issue on the Flutter GitHub repository, including `flutter doctor -v` output (from the new SDK), the exact error messages, and the steps you've taken.

## Step 6: Prompt for AI Assistant (If Clean SDK Works)

If using the `new_flutter_sdk` resolves the Android host app build errors:

```

I have successfully built the `ShareImageDriverAndroidOuterApp` (debug) after switching to a clean
Flutter SDK installation (`~/new_flutter_sdk`) as per POSSIBLE_NEXT_STEPS.md. The previous engine
artifact resolution errors are gone.

Please now proceed with:

1. Generating the `NON_AAR_README.md` for the source code integration approach.
2. Generating the `README_IOS.md` for iOS integration using XCFrameworks.
3. Confirming any final checks or code cleanup needed in the Android or Flutter projects.

```
